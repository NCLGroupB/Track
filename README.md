# Timeless Track
This is a group project for course Technologies in HCI in NCL university.
The code is for a portable device that can record and restore students memories,
The code is written in Python on a raspberry pi 4  and offers a simple GUI with 
the use of a stepper motor, a pi camera, an LCD touch screen, an RFID reader and a mic and headphones for recording and listening respectivly.

## General Info
In this project, we present a portable memory recording device inspired by a vintage vinyl player designed to enable students to capture their memories and create their own ‘footprint’ as Newcastle University students. A Raspberry Pi powers the device and features a camera module, microphone, speaker, stepper motor and an RFID reader enclosed in a wooden turntable design. The custom software offers a user-friendly interface for easy recording of audio and picture memories, which students can only view after graduation.
